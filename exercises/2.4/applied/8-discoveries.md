Using the `pairs(College)` function, able to spot pair-wise element correlation. Looks like PhD & Terminal degree variables are linearly correlated. Another pair of variables that look linearly correlated are the Enrollment numbers and the number of Full-time Undergrads.

I also think the Percentage of alumni who donate is not really correlated to the field which indicates the percentage of incoming freshmen that are in the top 10/25% of their highschool.

Another interesting pair of variables is the No. of faculty with PhD degrees and terminal degrees in their field. It looks like this doesn't really have a large effect on the Instructional expediture per student.

Something else that's interesting is student expenditure in public vs private school settings. While the image in `pairs(College)` gives off the vibe that private schools spend more when you plot a box-plot over these two variables they are actually much closer than I'd thought originally.
