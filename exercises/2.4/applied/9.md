##### Which of the predictors are quantitative/qualitative?
  - Quantitative: mpg, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration
  - Qualitative: Cylinders, year, origin, name
  - The histograms saved in pdf for this problem in histograms.pdf makes me think this is the case.
    Also, when I tried to plot a histogram of `Auto$name` R complained that `'x' must be numeric`.
##### What is the range of each quantitative predictor?
  - `mpg = [9.0, 46.6]`
  - `displacement = [68.0, 455.0]`
  - `horsepower = [46, 230]`
  - `weight = [1613, 5140]`
  - `acceleration = [8.0, 24.8]`
##### What is the mean and standard deviation of each quantitative predictor?
  - `mpg : mean = 23.44592, sd = 7.805007`
  - `displacement: mean=194.412, sd=104.644`
  - `horsepower: mean=104.4694, sd=38.49116`
  - `weight: mean=2977.584, sd=849.4026`
  - `acceleration: mean=15.54133, sd=2.758864`
##### Same as above, but removing the 10th thru 85th observations
  - `mpg : mean = 24.40443 sd = 7.867283, range=[11, 46.6]`
  - `displacement: mean=187.2405, sd=99.67837, range=[68, 455]`
  - `horsepower: mean=100.7215, sd=35.70885, range=[46, 230]`
  - `weight: mean=2935.972, sd=811.3002, range=[1649, 4997]`
  - `acceleration: mean=15.7269, sd=2.693721, range=[8.5, 24.8]`
##### Using the full data set, investigate the predictors graphically. Comment on your findings.
  - Pairwise graphs are in pairwise.pdf
  - From the pairwise graphs of mpg vs displacement/horsepower and weight there seems to be a
    negative correlation between these predictors and mpg.
  - A closer look at mpg and cylinders in mpg-cylinders-box.pdf shows that there seems to be quadratic
    relationship between the no. of cylinders and the mpg.
