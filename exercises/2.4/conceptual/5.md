 What are the advantages and disadvantages of a very ﬂexible (versus a less ﬂexible) approach for regression or classiﬁcation? Under what circumstances might a more ﬂexible approach be preferred to a less ﬂexible approach? When might a less ﬂexible approach be preferred?

A more flexible approach might be desired when we have an abundance of data and the relationship between the predictors and the response is non-linear. A less flexible approach might be desirable when we have an abundance of predictors relative to the number of observations or when we are observing a small train error but a large test error.
