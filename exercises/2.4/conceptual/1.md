For each of parts (a) through (d), indicate whether we would generally
expect the performance of a flexible statistical learning method to be
better or worse than an inflexible method. Justify your answer.
```
##### (a) The sample size n is extremely large, and the number of predictors p is small.
  - We should expect a __better__ performance from flexible methods in this case--as inflexible
    methods in general don't improve in performance as n grows.
##### (b) The number of predictors p is extremely large, and the number of observations n is small.
  - We should expect a __better__ performance from an inflexible method in this case--as
    we may not have sufficient data to train a flexible method. This is because flexible methods improve
    the more data they get. This is not true with an inflexible method, and so we could expect an 
    inflexible method to perform better given this small dataset.
##### (c) The relationship between the predictors and response is highly non-linear.
  - We should expect a __better__ performance from a flexible method as they are able to more
    easily capture non-linear relationships.
##### (d) The variance of the error terms, i.e.  Ïƒ^2=Var(epsilon) is extremely high.
  - We should expect a __better__ performance from an inflexible method as a flexible method may be liable
    to attempt to fit not just to the underlying relationship between the predictors and the response but
    also to the noise in the dataset; and this noise is:
    > extremely high
