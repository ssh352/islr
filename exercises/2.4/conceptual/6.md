Describe the diﬀerences between a parametric and a non-parametric statistical learning approach. What are the advantages of a parametric approach to regression or classiﬁcation (as opposed to a nonparametric approach)? What are its disadvantages?
```
Parametric models decide on the parameters to fit before fitting the data-set and thus the problem becomes a minimization problem on those chosen parameters. Non-parametric models learn what parameters best fit a data-set but are more complex as a result.

A parametric approach might have an advantage when the model fits the data, consider a linear regression fit applied to a dataset where the relationship between the predictors and the response is linear--this is a perfect match!
A parametric approach might be disadvantagueos if the relationship between the response and predictors is not suited to the model chosen (non-linear relationship fit to a linear model). It may also perform poorly if there 
are a large number of predictors relative to the no. of observations as it may fit the noise.

A non-parametric approach has an advantage when a large no. of observations relative to the no. of predictors is availible and also when the relationship between the predictors and response is non-linear.
This approach may be disadvantageous when the relationship between the predictors and the response is linear.
