This problem contains a table, so I didn't move it here.
```
See the R output below:
```
>X=matrix(c(0,2,0,0,-1,1,3,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,3,2,1,1),6,3)
>test = c(0,0,0)
>rep(1,5)
>matrix(c(apply(X,1,function(row)sqrt(sum((row - test)^2))),"Red","Red","Red","Green","Green","Red"),6,2)
3 2 3.16227766016838 2.23606797749979 1.4142135623731 1.73205080756888
Red Red Red Green Green Red
```
##### b) K = 1 => Green since it's the lowest distance
##### c) K = 3 => Red since 2 and 1.73 are both red and the closest three are 2 reds and 1.41 which is green.
##### d) Small, because when K=1 it looks like the bayes decision boundary which is non-linear. Conversely, when K is large the boundary looks linear.
